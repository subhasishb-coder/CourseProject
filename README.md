Introduction
------------
As final project for CS 410 Text Information System, we participated in Text Classification Competition to detect Twitter Sarcasm. We were given both Training and Test datasets.

The Training dataset Content
----------------------------
label: SARCASM or NOT_SARCASM
response: The Tweet to be classified
context: The conversation context of the response
example:
{"label": "SARCASM", "response": "@USER @USER @USER I don't get this .. obviously you do care or you would've moved right along .. instead you decided to care and troll her ..", "context": ["A minor child deserves privacy and should be kept out of politics . Pamela Karlan , you should be ashamed of your very angry and obviously biased public pandering , and using a child to do it .", "@USER If your child isn't named Barron ... #BeBest Melania couldn't care less . Fact . ðŸ’¯"]}

The Test dataset content
------------------------
id: String identifier for sample. This id is required for project submission and grading.
response: The Tweet to be classified
context: The conversation context of the response
example:
{"id": "twitter_1", "response": "@USER @USER @USER My 3 year old , that just finished reading Nietzsche and then asked me : \" ayo papa why these people always trying to cancel someone on Twitter , trying to pretend like that makes them better themselves ? \" . To which I replied \" idk \" , and he just \" cuz hoes mad \" . Im so proud . <URL>", "context": ["Well now that \u2019 s problematic AF <URL>", "@USER @USER My 5 year old ... asked me why they are making fun of Native Americans ..", "@USER @USER @USER I will take shit that didn't happen for $ 100", "@USER @USER @USER No .. he actually in the gifted program and reads on second grade level .  ... and he knows Kansas City is in Missouri"]}

Project Objective
-----------------
Our project objective is to learn from the Training dataset and predict the labels of Test dataset (SARCASM or NOT_SARCASM).
